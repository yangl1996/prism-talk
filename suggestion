--- DONE ---
trasition from theory to the practice
- theory is promising
- we want to understand what is the real-world performance
- follow the ccs paper intro section
    - complex protocol
    - simple network model, there could be large constants in the results
    - other bottlenecks (model assumes the network)

results is a bit late (the previous version is better, show the results earlier)

3 minutes over: too many results (remove the attacks)

clearly markred section in the talk about evaluation results
- testbed, 100-1000 vms, emulated the network
- ran several experiments: compare performance, robust under attacks, bottlenecks
  (resource consumption) -- to refer people to the paper

slide 2: remove the question in the slide
slide 3: bitcoin couples security and throughput, latency; new protocol "Prism" that
         decouples performance from security
k-deep: improve the script (1.5 min)
bitcoin performance analysis: after that, add a slide that dedicates to forking
                              (some people follows by looking at the slide)
tx blocks: propose tx block at high rate w/o impacting proposer forking BECAUSE proposer
           still mines at low rate
voter blocks: I'm going to introduce voters. JUST THINK OF IT AS DRAWING IN A DIFFERENT
              WAY. Still 25 deep.
implementation intro: expand UTXO
                      After that: summarize the performance (keep 20% dots), ll cover later

lessons learned: can be combined with conceptual design slide
                 OR, make a dedicated slide and add optimizations (and going to talk about)

scoreboard: annotate green box, cut the one-core example. start with "suppose 2 cores".
            have an arrow pointing down say the order of transactions
--- DONE ---

consensus: don't need to update the ledger when we receive each block
           implication: miner don't know the ledger state. okay in Prism
           invalid ones will be throwen away later
           OR, at the beginning of impl, add a functional diagram, show that output of
           consensus may have conflicts. say that the protocol allows invalid transaction
           to be included in blocks (this is specific to Prism)
